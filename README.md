## Setup

Currently this extension is under review and has not yet been accepted on the Raycast extension store.

If you would like to install it before it is accepted, follow the instructions below.

1. Install Node.js
   - Option A: Download from https://nodejs.org/
   - Option B: Use brew `brew install node`
2. [Download](https://github.com/martipops/popcorn-raycast/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone this repository
    - If you downloaded the .zip file, extract it to a folder in a safe place (e.g. Documents folder)
2. Open Terminal and navigate to the extracted directory
   - EX. `cd ~/Documents/popcorn-raycast-main`
3. Build the application by running `npm i; npm run build` (You should only need to do this once)
4. Open Raycast and search for "Import Extension"
5. Find and select the extension folder.
6. Configure your Stremio addon URL in the extensions preferences (e.g., `https://your-addon.com/manifest.json`)
7. Start searching for content!

### Troubleshooting

#### "Could not find command's executable JS file"
If you get this error, `npm install; npm run build` did not execute properly.
1. Make sure node is installed: `npm -v` returns a version number
2. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install; npm run build`
3. If the extension still doesn't work, run `npm run dev` and the extension should automatically pop up. You shouldn't have to keep that command running in the backround.
